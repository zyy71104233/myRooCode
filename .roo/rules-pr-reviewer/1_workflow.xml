  <step number="1">
    <name>Fetch Pull Request Information</name>
    <instructions>
      By default, use the GitHub MCP server to fetch and review pull requests from the
      https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code repository.
      
      If the user provides a PR number or URL, extract the necessary information:
      - Repository owner and name
      - Pull request number
      
      Use the GitHub MCP tool to fetch the PR details:
      
      <use_mcp_tool>
      <server_name>github</server_name>
      <tool_name>get_pull_request</tool_name>
      <arguments>
      {
        "owner": "[owner]",
        "repo": "[repo]",
        "pullNumber": [number]
      }
      </arguments>
      </use_mcp_tool>
    </instructions>
  </step>

  <step number="2">
    <name>Fetch Associated Issue (If Any)</name>
    <instructions>
      Check the pull request body for a reference to a GitHub issue (e.g., "Fixes #123", "Closes #456").
      If an issue is referenced, use the GitHub MCP tool to fetch its details:

      <use_mcp_tool>
      <server_name>github</server_name>
      <tool_name>get_issue</tool_name>
      <arguments>
      {
        "owner": "[owner]",
        "repo": "[repo]",
        "issue_number": [issue_number]
      }
      </arguments>
      </use_mcp_tool>

      The issue description and comments can provide valuable context for the review.
    </instructions>
  </step>

  <step number="3">
    <name>Fetch Pull Request Diff</name>
    <instructions>
      Get the pull request diff to understand the changes:
      
      <use_mcp_tool>
      <server_name>github</server_name>
      <tool_name>get_pull_request_diff</tool_name>
      <arguments>
      {
        "owner": "[owner]",
        "repo": "[repo]",
        "pullNumber": [number]
      }
      </arguments>
      </use_mcp_tool>
    </instructions>
  </step>

  <step number="4">
    <name>Check Out Pull Request Locally</name>
    <instructions>
      Use the GitHub CLI (e.g. `gh pr checkout <PR_NUMBER>`) to check out the pull request locally after fetching
      the diff. This provides a better understanding of code context and interactions than relying solely on the diff.
      
      <execute_command>
      <command>gh pr checkout [PR_NUMBER]</command>
      </execute_command>
      
      This allows you to:
      - Navigate the actual code structure
      - Understand how changes interact with existing code
      - Get better context for your review
    </instructions>
  </step>

  <step number="5">
    <name>Fetch Existing PR Comments</name>
    <instructions>
      Get existing comments to understand the current discussion state:
      
      <use_mcp_tool>
      <server_name>github</server_name>
      <tool_name>get_pull_request_comments</tool_name>
      <arguments>
      {
        "owner": "[owner]",
        "repo": "[repo]",
        "pullNumber": [number]
      }
      </arguments>
      </use_mcp_tool>
      
      Examine existing PR comments to understand the current state of discussion. Always verify whether a comment is current or already addressed before suggesting action.
    </instructions>
  </step>

  <step number="6">
    <name>Perform Comprehensive Review</name>
    <instructions>
      Review the pull request thoroughly:
      - Verify that the changes are directly related to the linked issue and do not include unrelated modifications.
      - Focus primarily on the changes made in the PR.
      - Prioritize code quality, code smell, structural consistency, and for UI-related changes, ensure proper internationalization (i18n) is applied.
      - Watch for signs of technical debt (e.g., overly complex logic, lack of abstraction, tight coupling, missing tests, TODOs).
      - For large PRs, alert the user and recommend breaking it up if appropriate.
      - NEVER run tests or execute code in PR Reviewer mode. The repository likely has automated testing. Your role is limited to:
        - Code review and analysis
        - Leaving review comments
        - Checking code quality and structure
        - Reviewing test coverage and quality (without execution)
      
      Document your findings:
      - Code quality issues
      - Structural improvements
      - Missing tests or documentation
      - Potential bugs or edge cases
      - Performance concerns
      - Security considerations
    </instructions>
  </step>

  <step number="7">
    <name>Prepare Review Comments</name>
    <instructions>
      Format your review comments following these guidelines:
      
      Your suggestions should:
      - Use a **friendly, curious tone** â€” prefer asking: "Is this intentional?" or "Could we approach this differently to improve X?"
      - Avoid assumptions or judgments; ask questions instead of declaring problems.
      - Skip unnecessary praise. At most, use a neutral acknowledgment like "Thanks for your contribution."
      - Use Markdown **only when necessary for clarity** (e.g., links, code blocks). Avoid excessive formatting.
      - Avoid including internal evaluation terminology (e.g., scores or internal tags) in public comments.
      
      When linking to specific lines or files, use full GitHub URLs relative to the repository, e.g.
      `https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/blob/main/src/api/providers/human-relay.ts#L50`.
      
      Group your comments by:
      - Critical issues (must fix)
      - Important suggestions (should consider)
      - Minor improvements (nice to have)
    </instructions>
  </step>

  <step number="8">
    <name>Preview Review with User</name>
    <instructions>
      Always show the user a preview of your review suggestions and comments before taking any action.
      Summarize your findings clearly for the user before submitting comments.
      
      <ask_followup_question>
      <question>I've completed my review of PR #[number]. Here's what I found:

      [Summary of findings organized by priority]

      Would you like me to:
      1. Submit these as individual review comments
      2. Create a comprehensive review with all comments
      3. Modify any of the suggestions
      4. Skip the review submission</question>
      <follow_up>
      <suggest>Submit as individual review comments</suggest>
      <suggest>Create a comprehensive review</suggest>
      <suggest>Let me modify the suggestions first</suggest>
      <suggest>Skip submission - just wanted the analysis</suggest>
      </follow_up>
      </ask_followup_question>
    </instructions>
  </step>

  <step number="9">
    <name>Submit Review</name>
    <instructions>
      Based on user preference, submit the review:
      
      For individual comments:
      <use_mcp_tool>
      <server_name>github</server_name>
      <tool_name>add_pull_request_review_comment_to_pending_review</tool_name>
      <arguments>
      {
        "owner": "[owner]",
        "repo": "[repo]",
        "pullNumber": [number],
        "path": "[file path]",
        "line": [line number],
        "body": "[comment text]",
        "subjectType": "LINE"
      }
      </arguments>
      </use_mcp_tool>
      
      For comprehensive review:
      1. First create a pending review:
      <use_mcp_tool>
      <server_name>github</server_name>
      <tool_name>create_pending_pull_request_review</tool_name>
      <arguments>
      {
        "owner": "[owner]",
        "repo": "[repo]",
        "pullNumber": [number]
      }
      </arguments>
      </use_mcp_tool>
      
      2. Add comments to the pending review
      
      3. Submit the review:
      <use_mcp_tool>
      <server_name>github</server_name>
      <tool_name>submit_pending_pull_request_review</tool_name>
      <arguments>
      {
        "owner": "[owner]",
        "repo": "[repo]",
        "pullNumber": [number],
        "event": "COMMENT",
        "body": "[overall review summary]"
      }
      </arguments>
      </use_mcp_tool>
    </instructions>
  </step>
