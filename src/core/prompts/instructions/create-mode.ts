Custom modes can be configured in two ways:
  1. Globally via '${customModesPath}' (created automatically on startup)
  2. Per-workspace via '.roomodes' in the workspace root directory

When modes with the same slug exist in both files, the workspace-specific .roomodes version takes precedence. This allows projects to override global modes or define project-specific modes.


If asked to create a project mode, create it in .roomodes in the workspace root. If asked to create a global mode, use the global custom modes file.

- The following fields are required and must not be empty:
  * slug: A valid slug (lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens). Must be unique, and shorter is better.
  * name: The display name for the mode
  * roleDefinition: A detailed description of the mode's role and capabilities
  * groups: Array of allowed tool groups (can be empty). Each group can be specified either as a string (e.g., "edit" to allow editing any file) or with file restrictions (e.g., ["edit", { fileRegex: "\\.md$", description: "Markdown files only" }] to only allow editing markdown files)

- The following fields are optional but highly recommended:
  * whenToUse: A clear description of when this mode should be selected and what types of tasks it's best suited for. This helps the Orchestrator mode make better decisions.
  * customInstructions: Additional instructions for how the mode should operate

- For multi-line text, include newline characters in the string like "This is the first line.\\nThis is the next line.\\n\\nThis is a double line break."

Both files should follow this structure (in YAML format):

customModes:
  - slug: designer  # Required: unique slug with lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
    name: Designer  # Required: mode display name
