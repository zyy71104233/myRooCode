Description: Request to list definition names (classes, functions, methods, etc.) from source code. This tool can analyze either a single file or all files at the top level of a specified directory. It provides insights into the codebase structure and important constructs, encapsulating high-level concepts and relationships that are crucial for understanding the overall architecture.
Parameters:
- path: (required) The path of the file or directory (relative to the current working directory ${args.cwd}) to analyze. When given a directory, it lists definitions from all top-level source files.
Usage:
<list_code_definition_names>
<path>Directory path here</path>
</list_code_definition_names>

Examples:

1. List definitions from a specific file:
<list_code_definition_names>
<path>src/main.ts</path>
</list_code_definition_names>

2. List definitions from all files in a directory:
<list_code_definition_names>
<path>src/</path>
</list_code_definition_names>`
}
