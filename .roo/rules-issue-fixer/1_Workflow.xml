  <step number="1">
    <name>Determine Workflow Type and Retrieve Context</name>
    <instructions>
      First, determine what type of work is needed. The user will provide either:
      - An issue number/URL (e.g., "#123" or GitHub issue URL) - for new implementation
      - A PR number/URL (e.g., "#456" or GitHub PR URL) - for addressing review feedback
      - A description of changes needed for an existing PR
      
      For Issue-based workflow:
      Extract the issue number and retrieve it:
      
      <use_mcp_tool>
      <server_name>github</server_name>
      <tool_name>get_issue</tool_name>
      <arguments>
      {
        "owner": "RooCodeInc",
        "repo": "Roo-Code",
        "issue_number": [extracted number]
      }
      </arguments>
      </use_mcp_tool>
      
      For PR Review workflow:
      Extract the PR number and retrieve it:
      
      <use_mcp_tool>
      <server_name>github</server_name>
      <tool_name>get_pull_request</tool_name>
      <arguments>
      {
        "owner": "RooCodeInc",
        "repo": "Roo-Code",
        "pull_number": [extracted number]
      }
      </arguments>
      </use_mcp_tool>
      
      Then get PR review comments:
      
      <use_mcp_tool>
      <server_name>github</server_name>
      <tool_name>get_pull_request_reviews</tool_name>
      <arguments>
      {
        "owner": "RooCodeInc",
        "repo": "Roo-Code",
        "pull_number": [extracted number]
      }
      </arguments>
      </use_mcp_tool>
      
      Analyze the context to determine:
      1. Type of work (new issue implementation vs PR feedback)
      2. All requirements and acceptance criteria
      3. Specific changes requested (for PR reviews)
      4. Technical details mentioned
      5. Any linked issues or discussions
    </instructions>
  </step>

  <step number="2">
    <name>Review Issue Comments and Related Context</name>
    <instructions>
      Get all comments on the issue to understand:
      - Additional context or clarifications
      - Maintainer feedback
      - Community suggestions
      - Any decisions or changes to requirements
      
      <use_mcp_tool>
      <server_name>github</server_name>
      <tool_name>get_issue_comments</tool_name>
      <arguments>
      {
        "owner": "RooCodeInc",
        "repo": "Roo-Code",
        "issue_number": [issue number]
      }
      </arguments>
      </use_mcp_tool>
      
      Also check for:
      1. Related issues mentioned in the body or comments
      2. Linked pull requests
      3. Referenced discussions
      
      Document all requirements and constraints found.
    </instructions>
  </step>

  <step number="3">
    <name>Explore Codebase and Related Files</name>
    <instructions>
      Use codebase_search FIRST to understand the codebase structure and find ALL related files:
      
      For Bug Fixes:
      - Search for the broken functionality
      - Find error handling and logging
      - Locate related test files
      - Identify dependencies and imports
      - Find similar patterns in the codebase
      
      For Features:
      - Search for similar existing features
      - Find integration points
      - Locate configuration files
      - Identify patterns to follow
      - Find related components and utilities
      
      For PR Reviews:
      - Search for files mentioned in review comments
      - Find related files that use similar patterns
      - Locate test files for modified functionality
      - Identify files that import/depend on changed code
      
      Example searches based on issue type:
      - Bug: Search for error messages, function names, component names
      - Feature: Search for similar functionality, API endpoints, UI components
      - PR Review: Search for patterns mentioned in feedback
      
      CRITICAL: Always read multiple related files together to understand:
      - Current code patterns and conventions
      - How similar functionality is implemented
      - Testing patterns used in the project
      - Import/export patterns
      - Error handling approaches
      - Configuration and setup patterns
      
      Then use other tools:
      - list_code_definition_names to understand file structure
      - read_file to examine specific implementations (read multiple files at once)
      - search_files for specific patterns or error messages
      
      Also use GitHub tools:
      - list_commits to see recent changes to affected files
      - get_commit to understand specific changes
      - list_pull_requests to find related PRs
      
      Document:
      - All files that need modification
      - Current implementation details and patterns
      - Code conventions to follow (naming, structure, etc.)
      - Test file locations and patterns
      - Related files that might be affected
    </instructions>
  </step>

  <step number="4">
    <name>Create Implementation Plan</name>
    <instructions>
      Based on the issue analysis, create a detailed implementation plan:
      
      For Bug Fixes:
      1. Reproduce the bug locally (if possible)
      2. Identify root cause
      3. Plan the fix approach. The plan should be focused on resolving the issue with a high-quality, targeted fix, while avoiding unrelated changes.
      4. Identify files to modify.
      5. Plan test cases to prevent regression.
      
      For Feature Implementation:
      1. Break down the feature into components
      2. Identify all files that need changes
      3. Plan the implementation approach
      4. Consider edge cases and error handling
      5. Plan test coverage
      
      Present the plan to the user:
      
      <ask_followup_question>
      <question>I've analyzed issue #[number]: "[title]"

      Here's my implementation plan to resolve the issue:

      [Detailed plan with steps and affected files]

      This plan focuses on providing a quality fix for the reported problem without introducing unrelated changes.

      Would you like me to proceed with this implementation?</question>
      <follow_up>
      <suggest>Yes, proceed with the implementation</suggest>
      <suggest>Let me review the issue first</suggest>
      <suggest>Modify the approach for: [specific aspect]</suggest>
      <suggest>Focus only on: [specific part]</suggest>
      </follow_up>
      </ask_followup_question>
    </instructions>
  </step>

  <step number="5">
    <name>Implement the Solution</name>
    <instructions>
      Implement the fix or feature following the plan:
      
      General Guidelines:
      1. Follow existing code patterns and style
      2. Add appropriate error handling
      3. Include necessary comments
      4. Update related documentation
      5. Ensure backward compatibility (if applicable)
      
      For Bug Fixes:
      1. Implement the planned fix, focusing on quality and precision.
      2. The scope of the fix should be as narrow as possible to address the issue. Avoid making changes to code that is not directly related to the fix. This is not an encouragement for one-line hacks, but a guideline to prevent unintended side-effects.
      3. Add regression tests.
      4. Verify the fix resolves the issue.
      5. Check for side effects.
      
      For Features:
      1. Implement incrementally
      2. Test each component as you build
      3. Follow the acceptance criteria exactly
      4. Add comprehensive tests
      5. Update documentation
      
      Use appropriate tools:
      - apply_diff for targeted changes
      - write_to_file for new files
      - search_and_replace for systematic updates
      
      After each significant change, run relevant tests:
      - execute_command to run test suites
      - Check for linting errors
      - Verify functionality works as expected
    </instructions>
  </step>

  <step number="6">
    <name>Verify Acceptance Criteria</name>
    <instructions>
      Systematically verify all acceptance criteria from the issue:
      
      For Bug Fixes:
      1. Confirm the bug no longer reproduces
      2. Follow the exact reproduction steps
      3. Verify expected behavior now occurs
      4. Check no new bugs introduced
      5. Run all related tests
      
      For Features:
      1. Test each acceptance criterion
      2. Verify all Given/When/Then scenarios
      3. Test edge cases
      4. Verify UI changes (if applicable)
      5. Check performance impact
      
      Document verification results:
      - [ ] Criterion 1: [result]
      - [ ] Criterion 2: [result]
      - [ ] All tests passing
      - [ ] No linting errors
      
      If any criteria fail, return to implementation step.
    </instructions>
  </step>

  <step number="7">
    <name>Run Tests and Checks</name>
    <instructions>
      Run comprehensive tests to ensure quality:
      
      1. Run unit tests for modified files:
         ```
         npm test [test file paths]
         ```
      
      2. Run integration tests if applicable:
         ```
         npm run test:integration
         ```
      
      3. Check for linting errors:
         ```
         npm run lint
         ```
      
      4. Run type checking:
         ```
         npm run type-check
         ```
      
      5. If UI changes, test manually:
         - Build the extension
         - Test in VSCode
         - Verify visual changes
      
      Document all test results and fix any failures.
